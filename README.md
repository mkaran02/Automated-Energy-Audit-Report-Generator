# ⚡ Automated Energy Report Generator

The **Automated Energy Report Generator** is a Python-based solution that analyzes hourly energy usage data (like from AEP - American Electric Power) and generates insightful audit reports. This helps facilities or organizations better understand consumption patterns, identify inefficiencies, and take action for energy savings.

---

## 📊 Features

- 📥 Load and parse hourly energy data from CSV format.
- 📈 Visualize energy usage trends with plots and statistics.
- 🧠 Detect usage anomalies or peak load times.
- 🧾 Automatically generate energy audit reports using Jupyter Notebooks.
- 📤 Export results to HTML or PDF for easy sharing.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

├── auditreport.ipynb # Main Jupyter notebook to run the analysis
├── AEP_hourly.csv # Sample input dataset with hourly energy usage
├── output/ # Folder for generated plots and reports (create manually)
├── README.md # Project documentation


## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter
Or
you can install them all via a requirements.txt:

text
Copy
Edit
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
jupyter

Install with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

📁 Input Format
The input file should be a CSV containing hourly energy data, for example:

Datetime	AEP_MW
2004-12-31 01:00:00	13478
2004-12-31 02:00:00	12987
...	...

Datetime: Timestamp of the reading.

AEP_MW: Energy usage in megawatts (MW).

🚀 How to Run
▶️ Using Jupyter Notebook
Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook auditreport.ipynb


Step through the notebook cells one by one:

Load and clean data

Generate time series plots

Compute daily/weekly/monthly averages

Highlight peak load periods

Generate visualizations and summaries

Save or export the final report as HTML or PDF.




📌 Example Insights
⚠️ Peak load on July 19, 2012 at 5 PM: 22,473 MW

📉 Lowest consumption: 6,547 MW on Jan 1st, 2005 at 3 AM

📅 Highest average usage in: August

📄 Report Output
The notebook can generate:

📊 Plots of hourly/daily/monthly usage

🧾 Tables of average consumption and peak load

📈 Anomaly detection (optional: using statistical thresholds)

📤 Exportable report for sharing or compliance

🧠 Future Enhancements
📬 Email reports automatically

🧠 Add ML-based anomaly detection

🧩 Integrate with live data streams (e.g., IoT sensors or APIs)

🌍 Web interface for uploading and viewing reports
